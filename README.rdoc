= irbtools

This is a meta gem which installs some useful irb gems and configures your irb.

== Setup

  gem install irbtools
  gem install irb_rocket --source http://merbi.st
  
* On Linux, you also need the +xclip+ program (apt-get install xclip).
* On MacOS, you need growl, if you want to use the +g+ gem.

== Usage

To use it, put the following in your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt> file (this file is loaded everytime you start an irb):

  require 'rubygems' # only needed in 1.8
  require 'irbtools'

If it does not exists, just create a new one.

It's possible to modify, which libraries get loaded:

  require 'irbtools/configure'
  # here you can edit the <tt>Irbtools.libs</tt> array or add libraries inclusive load callbacks with <tt>Irbtools.add_library</tt>
  Irbtools.init

You could also just read and copy the source files, tweak them, put them together and use them directly as <tt>.irbrc</tt> ;)
