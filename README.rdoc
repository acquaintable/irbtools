= irbtools
This is a meta gem which installs useful irb gems and configures your irb. It has a modular structure and supports multiple library-loading mechanisms like via <tt>autoload</tt> or threads.

== Setup
  gem install irbtools
  
* On Linux, you need +xclip+ or +xsel+ to use the clipboard: sudo <tt>apt-get install xclip</tt>
* On Windows, you need ansicon[https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon] to enjoy all the colors
* On MacOS, you will need growl, if you want to use the +g+ gem.

=== Wrong display widths?
When using double-width unicode chars, you should need to pass the <tt>:east_asian_width = true</tt> when starting <tt>FancyIrb</tt>. It is deactivated because of performance issues.

== Usage
To use it, put the following in your <tt>~/.irbrc</tt> file (this file is loaded every time you start an irb):

  require 'rubygems' unless defined? Gem # rubygems is only needed in 1.8
  require 'irbtools'

If it does not exist, just create a new one.

It's possible to modify, which libraries get loaded:

  # don't require 'irbtools'
  require 'irbtools/configure'
  # here you can modify which libraries get loaded (see below)
  Irbtools.start

=== Rails notes
To use irbtools within the rails console, you will have to add irbtools to your Gemfile <b>in this way:</b> (or there will be some bundler double require issues..)

  gem 'irbtools', :require => 'irbtools/configure'

You can put Rails specific configuration in a <tt>~/.railsrc</tt> file which gets loaded only in Rails environments.

=== How to load more or less libraries
You have the following ways:
* <tt>Irbtools.add_library(lib, options_hash, &block)</tt>
* <tt>Irbtools.remove_library(lib)</tt>

The <tt>options_hash</tt> defines the way in which Irbtools loads the library. Following options are possible
* (no options) - The library is loaded on startup via <tt>require</tt> (before displaying the prompt)
* <tt>:thread => identifier</tt> - After loading everything else, the library is required in a thread (while showing the prompt). You can choose any identifier, but if you take the same one for multiple libraries, they will be loaded in the same thread (in the order that you define)
* <tt>:after_rc => true</tt> - sub-session
* <tt>:autoload => :Constant</tt> - Use Ruby's <tt>autoload</tt> feature. It loads the library as soon as the constant is encountered.

You can also apply a block that gets executed after the library is loaded (except for autoload, the code will executed on startup in this case).

See the <tt>Irbtools.libraries</tt> hash for the current Irbtools configuration, which actually will be used.

==== Packages
There are irbtools extension packages, which can be modified via:
* <tt>Irbtools.add_package(pkg)</tt>
* <tt>Irbtools.remove_package(pkg)</tt>

These packages add/modify the libraries to be loaded. For an example, see {irbtools-more}[https://github.com/janlelis/irbtools-more].

== Features

* sketches[http://sketches.rubyforge.org/]   another, more flexible "start editor and it gets loaded into your irb session" plugin
* zucker[http:/rubyzucker.info]   nice debug printing (q, o, c, .m, .d) + useful pseudo-constants (Info, OS, RubyVersion, RubyEngine)
* ap[https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print]      nice debug printing (ap) [also see wp from wirb/wp]

=== Not included anymore

* guessmethod[http://guessmethod.rubyforge.org/]    automatically corrects typos (method_missing hook)

=== Helper methods
See the source for a description. These methods are defined directly by irbtools. Each gem may add its own helper methods.

*General*: <tt>ls, cat, rq, rrq/rerequire, ld, session_history, reset!, clear, use_ruby/use, rubies, use_gemset/gemset, gemsets, dbg</tt>

*Clipboard*: <tt>copy, paste, copy_input, copy_output</tt>

*CodeRay*: <tt>colorize, ray</tt>

==== RVM
If you have RVM installed, you can switch your gemset or ruby with <tt>gemset</tt> and <tt>use</tt> (use <tt>gemsets</tt> and <tt>rubies</tt> to get a list). The gemset can be changed within the session, while changing ruby starts a new one. Please also note that you need to have installed irbtools for that ruby version. I recommend installing it in the <tt>global</tt> gemset.

== Welcome message
The welcome message can be customized with <tt>Irbtools.welcome_message=</tt>
